# AI policy

## when in doubt, don't

contributions generated by AI are *not* welcome; AI assistance is tolerated, and not encouraged, and strict rules apply.

this repo has a *zero tolerance* AI policy, meaning anything breaking such rules will result in closing issues or PRs, shutting down discussions, or even banning people from the repo.

* when it comes to "speaking", *do not* copy AI responses as if they were your own words!! that's *bad*!
* when it comes to "code", you accept full responsibility for AI assisted contributions, and also:
  * all AI contributions must be *fully* vetted by the submitter
  * AI, often times, produces a lot *bad* text; just because your favorite LLM produces 200 words per second on a github issue, it doesn't mean it's relevant, or even if it is, that it is readable
* AI as co-contributors are rejected, always
* when it comes to security / vulnerability reports, LLM must *not* be involved in *any* way

## be human

this is important, so keep this in mind: **we expect all interactions to be human interactions**.

it is *never* acceptable to copy the response of an LLM or AI tool and use it **as if it were your own words**; be wary: violating this leads to immediate consequences.

it is *also* not acceptable to link a conversation with an agent: **if we want to read schlop from an AI, we would generate it ourselves**.

## AI assisted code

while the above still applies, AI-assisted development is fine, as long as:
* you take full responsibility with it
* you read the whole thing you're submitting
* you end up not being verbose
* you write meaningful tests to support your contributions
* you write meaningful documentation to help users

this applies to:
* code
* documentation
* commit messages
